/**
 * `doubleIt` is a function that takes one argument and returns no value.
 * The argument is a pointer to `int`. The function doubles the value that
 * the argument points to and stores it back. `savings` is an `int` variable
 * that has been declared and initialized.
 * 
 * Write a statement that doubles the value stored in `savings` by invoking
 * the function `doubleIt`.
 * 
 * For example, if the value in `savings` was 7 before your statement,
 * after your statement its value would be 14.
