/**
 * `minMax` is a function that takes five arguments and returns no value.
 * The first three arguments are of type `int`. The last two arguments are
 * pointers to `int` that are set by the function to the largest and
 * smallest of the values of the first three parameters, respectively.
 * 
 * x, y and z are three `int` variables that have been declared and initialized.
 * `big` and `small` are two `int` variables that have been declared.
 * 
 * Write a statement that sets the value of `big` to the largest of x, y, z and
 * sets the value of `small` to the smallest of x, y, z by calling `minMax`.
