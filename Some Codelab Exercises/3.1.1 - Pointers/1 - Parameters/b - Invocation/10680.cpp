/**
 * `divide` is a function that takes four arguments and returns no value.
 * The first two arguments are of type `int`. The last two arguments are
 * pointers to `int` that are set by the function to the quotient and remainder
 * of dividing the first argument by the second argument. The function does not
 * return a value.
 * 
 * x and y are two `int` variables that have been declared and initialized.
 * q and r are two `int` variables that have been declared.
 * 
 * Write a statement that sets the value of q to the quotient of x divided by y,
 * and sets the value of r to the remainder of x divided by y, by calling `divide`.
