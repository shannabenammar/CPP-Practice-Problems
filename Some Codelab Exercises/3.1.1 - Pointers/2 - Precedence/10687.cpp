/**
 * Write an expression that evaluates to 1 more than the
 * value in the location pointed to by the integer pointer
 * variable `ip`. Thus, if `ip` points to a location containing
 * the value 3, the expression should evaluate to 4.

// Expression, not full statement
// So we just have to get the int value of pointer ip and add 1
*ip + 1
